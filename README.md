# 💰 Expense Tracker (Java Console App)

As an international student studying in Germany, managing monthly expenses can be a real challenge — especially while planning yearly trips back home to Sri Lanka.  
I wanted a simple way to track my spending, set monthly savings goals, and make sure I save enough each month for travel and emergencies.

This project, built in **Java**, helps me (and other students) record income, track expenses, and stay on top of personal budgets in an easy console-based system.



## ✨ Features
- Add monthly income and saving goal  
- Enter unlimited expenses (description + amount)  
- Validates that saving goal is not higher than income  
- Automatically calculates:
  - Total Income  
  - Total Expenses  
  - Remaining Balance  
  - Savings Performance  
- Saves expense data to a CSV file  


## 🧠 Concepts Used
- **OOP Principles:** Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation  
- **Java Collections:** Lists and Maps  
- **Exception Handling:** Input validation and error handling  
- **File I/O:** CSV export  



## 🛠️ Technologies
- Java 17+  
- Eclipse IDE  



## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Randinu20231819/ExpenseTracker.git
